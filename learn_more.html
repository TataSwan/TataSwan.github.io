            <p class="mistakes-subheadeing">
                To become a successful trader, there are a lot of things to consider.
                Most new forex traders venture into forex with urgency and great excitement to start making large sums of money.
                The market is not an easy place to make cash at will. The market can go either direction, not just down. You need to have a robust trading strategy to outwit efficient, risk management and a firm trading psychology for consistent income. For this article,
                we will look at the worst and obvious mistakes that new forex traders make.
            </p>

            <ul class="list-of-mistakes">
                <li class="list-of-mistakes-item">
                    <h4 class="list-of-mistakes-item-heading">1. Going Live without Learning</h4>
                    <p class="list-of-mistakes-item-text">This is the most common mistake a significant number of new traders make. To invest in forex, you need to have a deeper understanding of the market
                        and how it works. You will find a lot of resources online. Some may even mislead you. Read several books, tutorials, articles and journals authored by
                        well-renowned traders who make a living out of the Market. You can also follow the experienced traders on their Facebook, twitter, Telegram and Instagram accounts. There is no shortcut, learn then grow.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-of-mistakes-item">
                    <h4 class="list-of-mistakes-item-heading">2. Going Live without a Strategy</h4>
                    <p class="list-of-mistakes-item-text">Wealthy traders have and stick to a strategy. They understand their entry points and exit points. They know what pairs to trade. They know what setups to trade. They also know what amount of losses they are willing to take, depending on their accounts’ size. New traders venture in and make massive losses with even a plan. As a new trader, learn to stick to your plan. Trade pairs that you are conversant with. Besides, avoid accumulating massive losses.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-of-mistakes-item">
                    <h4 class="list-of-mistakes-item-heading">3. Accumulating Losses</h4>
                    <p class="list-of-mistakes-item-text">Beginner traders take their profits very fast but are slow to stop losses. This makes you fewer profits compared to the losses.
                        To survive in the market as a new trader, you have to minimize your losses as much as possible. </p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-of-mistakes-item">
                    <h4 class="list-of-mistakes-item-heading">4. Failure to use Stop Loss (SL) Orders</h4>
                    <p class="list-of-mistakes-item-text">Stop Loss Order is essential for successive trading. Inability to implement SL orders is the worst mistake new traders make.
                        SL orders assist you in minimizing the amount of losses one can accumulate and also locking profits. In some cases, you may need to cancel SL order if it is going to be triggered before the reversal. This will help you still make profits.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-of-mistakes-item">
                    <h4 class="list-of-mistakes-item-heading">5. Following the Herd or a Guru</h4>
                    <p class="list-of-mistakes-item-text">Avoid following others blindly. Let the trend be your friend. Avoid purchasing secret systems or trading formulas.
                        Convince them to teach you how to fish. </p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-of-mistakes-item">
                    <h4 class="list-of-mistakes-item-heading">6. Trading too frequently</h4>
                    <p class="list-of-mistakes-item-text">Trading too often can erode your profits. While rich traders have learned after making losses that overtrading can be severely harmful to a trader's
                        overall performance and returns, beginner traders may have up till now not learned this crucial lesson.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-of-mistakes-item">
                    <h4 class="list-of-mistakes-item-heading">7. Trading with excessive Leverage</h4>
                    <p class="list-of-mistakes-item-text">It is better to make huge profits with a small leverage rather than small win with a big position size. Learn to take small risks.
                        Trading with a big leverage can wipe out your entire account in a matter of seconds.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-of-mistakes-item">
                    <h4 class="list-of-mistakes-item-heading">8. Greed</h4>
                    <p class="list-of-mistakes-item-text">New traders let greed take over. Failure to exit before the market retrace can result in losses in a trade that was in profits.
                        Learn how to manage your losses as well as exiting the right time with profits.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-of-mistakes-item">
                    <h4 class="list-of-mistakes-item-heading">9. Trading Multiple Markets</h4>
                    <p class="list-of-mistakes-item-text">New traders may flit from one market to other. In some case from options to stocks to commodities to currencies, just to mention a few.
                        This may be a big distraction and may hinder a new trader from perfecting in one market and gaining good experience. </p>
                </li>
                <li class="list-of-mistakes-item">
                    <h4 class="list-of-mistakes-item-heading">10. Focusing their efforts on setups and entries</h4>
                    <p class="list-of-mistakes-item-text">When you go wrong with a trade, learn to cut the losses faster. Besides, you may trade longer timeframes.
                        The experienced and rich traders will agree with me on that.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
